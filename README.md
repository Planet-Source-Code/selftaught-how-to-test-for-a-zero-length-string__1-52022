## How to test for a zero\-length string


</div>

### Description

This code is irrefutable proof that LenB(String) is 50% to 90% faster than testing for String = "". Most of you I'm sure already know this, but to my surprise someone tried to correct me saying that the latter was the correct way. So for all those who can benefit from this code, give it a try. Only 2.5 KB download.
